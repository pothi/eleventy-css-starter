# Eleventy CSS Workflow

Eleventy doesn't come with asset management on its own. It's actually a good thing so that we can use whatever fits our usecase. So, here I used postcss to process t
ailwind. You may replace tailwind with your favorite CSS framework or just remove tailwind.

This is not the original idea. It's copied from https://github.com/jevets/crittercomics. So, the full credit of this idea goes to [Steve Jamesson](https://github.com/jevets).
